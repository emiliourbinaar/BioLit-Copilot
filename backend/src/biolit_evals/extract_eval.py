    PROXY, NOT GROUND TRUTH. BC5CDR annotates CID relations at DOCUMENT level; sentence-level
    co-occurrence is this project's inference about where the relation is asserted. Some
    qualifying sentences state background rather than a finding, and a paper's actual key
    finding may concern efficacy, which CID does not annotate at all. A high score against
    this gold means "selects sentences containing the annotated relation" -- NOT "selects the
    paper's key finding". Cite it that way.

    The resulting sentence COUNT is a regression pin, not an independent validation: no
    published corpus statistic exists for it. The independent invariant is that the number
    of relations with >=1 gold sentence is <= 1066 (BC5CDR Test-500's published gold CID
    relation count) -- every gold sentence traces back to a real relation, never invented.
